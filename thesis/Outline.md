# Outline
1. Abstract
2. Introduction (What am I implementing? What are my goals? (vol. RT, parallelization))
3. Approximations (Which approximations did I try for the necessary math functions?)
4. Parallelization (How did I try to parallelize the sequential implementation?)
5. Experiments (How do I measure performance? Full Runs? Single functions? Process time? Wall clock? HW cycles?)
6. Results (Performance measurements etc.)
7. Discussion
8. Future Work (How could one expand or improve on the implementation?)
