# Outline
1. Abstract
2. Introduction (What am I implementing? What are my goals? (vol. RT, parallelization))
3. Methods (How do I measure performance? Full Runs? Single functions? Process time? Wall clock? HW cycles?)
4. Approximations (Which approximations did I try for the necessary math functions?)
5. Parallelization (How did I try to parallelize the sequential implementation?)
6. Results (Performance measurements etc.)
7. Future Work (How could one expand or improve on the implementation?)
