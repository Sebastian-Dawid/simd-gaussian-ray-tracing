- [ ] • propose or describe? [See in file](main.tex#L53)
- [ ] • describe image formation model (splatting) as laid out in the following pagpers [See in file](main.tex#L119)
- [ ] • What differentiates the two methods? Advantages? Disadvantages? [See in file](main.tex#L124)
- [ ] • Write introductory paragraph on optimizations [See in file](main.tex#L127)
