# TODOs
<!---@TODO-List-Start--->
- [ ] • describe image formation model (splatting) as laid out in the following papers [See in file](main.tex#L158)
- [ ] • This is not part of the paper technically -> how do I cite this? [See in file](main.tex#L180)
- [ ] • Wording seems iffy, should rework this [See in file](main.tex#L181)
- [ ] • Explain why it is necessary to approximate functions / implement own approximations [See in file](main.tex#L478)
- [ ] • details TBD [See in file](main.tex#L618)
- [ ] • Description of the functionality of the library [See in file](main.tex#L682)
- [ ] • should I mention wasted pipelining opportunities here? [See in file](main.tex#L767)
- [ ] • wording w.r.t color arithmetic seems weird? [See in file](main.tex#L1104)
- [ ] • This section needs more detail [See in file](main.tex#L1133)
- [ ] • Do I need this section? Do I have relevant experiments w.r.t the transmittance? \section{Transmittance} [See in file](main.tex#L1244)
- [ ] • Rerun HPCTOOLKIT tests using Utah Newell Teapot instead of Dense Cube [See in file](main.tex#L1254)
- [ ] • Verify this: [See in file](main.tex#L1292)
- [ ] • Short recap + what can still be done: anisotropic Gaussians, loading models learned via Gaussian splatting, more efficient tiling method using SIMD, performance left on the table TBD (see results) [See in file](main.tex#L1383)
- [ ] • fill out interfaces [See in file](main.tex#L1652)
