- [ ] • Should I keep citing the full name of papers upon introduction? [See in file](main.tex#L66)
- [ ] • Move this to the implementation section entirely since it is too implementation oriented? [See in file](main.tex#L551)
- [ ] • Create figure to show this if there is enough time [See in file](main.tex#L817)
- [ ] • Do I need a reason here? [See in file](main.tex#L873)
- [ ] • Move at least part of this to the appendix? Would I need a new appendix chapter for this? [See in file](main.tex#L1498)
