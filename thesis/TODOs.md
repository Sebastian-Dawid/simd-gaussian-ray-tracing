- [ ] • Wording seems iffy, should rework this [See in file](main.tex#L200)
- [ ] • should I mention wasted pipelining opportunities here? [See in file](main.tex#L806)

- [ ] • Paragraph on filters -> filtered out scopes count towards the parent scope in exclusive metrics [See in file](main.tex#L1468)
- [ ] • Rerun HPCTOOLKIT tests using Utah Newell Teapot instead of Dense Cube [See in file](main.tex#L1526)
- [ ] • This conclusion does not make sense given the data [See in file](main.tex#L1594)
- [ ] • Short recap + what can still be done: anisotropic Gaussians, loading models learned via Gaussian splatting, more efficient tiling method using SIMD, performance left on the table TBD (see results) [See in file](main.tex#L1670)
