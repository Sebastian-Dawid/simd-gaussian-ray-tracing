# TODOs
<!---@TODO-List-Start--->
- [ ] • describe image formation model (splatting) as laid out in the following papers [See in file](main.tex#L158)
- [ ] • This is not part of the paper technically -> how do I cite this? [See in file](main.tex#L180)
- [ ] • Wording seems iffy, should rework this [See in file](main.tex#L181)
- [ ] • Explain why it is necessary to approximate functions / implement own approximations [See in file](main.tex#L478)
- [ ] • details TBD [See in file](main.tex#L618)
- [ ] • Description of the functionality of the library [See in file](main.tex#L705)
- [ ] • should I mention wasted pipelining opportunities here? [See in file](main.tex#L790)
- [ ] • wording w.r.t color arithmetic seems weird? [See in file](main.tex#L1127)
- [ ] • This section needs more detail [See in file](main.tex#L1156)
- [ ] • Rerun HPCTOOLKIT tests using Utah Newell Teapot instead of Dense Cube [See in file](main.tex#L1332)
- [ ] • Verify this: [See in file](main.tex#L1370)
- [ ] • Short recap + what can still be done: anisotropic Gaussians, loading models learned via Gaussian splatting, more efficient tiling method using SIMD, performance left on the table TBD (see results) [See in file](main.tex#L1461)
- [ ] • fill out interfaces [See in file](main.tex#L1730)
