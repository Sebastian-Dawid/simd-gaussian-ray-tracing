<!---@TODO-List-Start--->
- [ ] • describe image formation model (splatting) as laid out in the following papers [See in file](main.tex#L143)
- [ ] • What differentiates the two methods? Advantages? Disadvantages? [See in file](main.tex#L148)
- [ ] • Write introductory paragraph on optimizations [See in file](main.tex#L151)
- [ ] • rename to vectorization -> SIMD in Chpter 4 [See in file](main.tex#L158)
- [ ] • describe the tiling method used. note similarities to splatting. [See in file](main.tex#L305)
- [ ] • Explain why it is necessary to approximate functions / implement own approximations [See in file](main.tex#L328)
- [ ] • Describe cubic spline interpolation [See in file](main.tex#L330)
- [ ] • details TBD [See in file](main.tex#L351)
- [ ] • Short recap + what can still be done: anisotropic gaussians, loading models learned via gaussian splatting, more efficient tiling method using SIMD, performance left on the table TBD (see results) [See in file](main.tex#L450)
