- [ ] • describe image formation model (splatting) as laid out in the following papers [See in file](main.tex#L151)
- [ ] • What differentiates the two methods? Advantages? Disadvantages? [See in file](main.tex#L178)
- [ ] • Write introductory paragraph on optimizations [See in file](main.tex#L182)
- [ ] • describe the tiling method used. note similarities to splatting. [See in file](main.tex#L351)
- [ ] • Note mathematical justification for using 3.3 sigma as limit [See in file](main.tex#L417)
- [ ] • Explain why it is necessary to approximate functions / implement own approximations [See in file](main.tex#L437)
- [ ] • Describe cubic spline interpolation [See in file](main.tex#L450)
- [ ] • details TBD [See in file](main.tex#L511)
- [ ] • Description of the functionality of the library [See in file](main.tex#L549)
- [ ] • Rerun HPCTOOLKIT tests using Utah Newell Teapot instead of Dense Cube [See in file](main.tex#L755)
- [ ] • Short recap + what can still be done: anisotropic Gaussians, loading models learned via Gaussian splatting, more efficient tiling method using SIMD, performance left on the table TBD (see results) [See in file](main.tex#L854)
