# TODOs
<!---@TODO-List-Start--->
- [ ] • describe image formation model (splatting) as laid out in the following papers [See in file](main.tex#L161)
- [ ] • This is not part of the paper technically -> how do I cite this? [See in file](main.tex#L183)
- [ ] • Wording seems iffy, should rework this [See in file](main.tex#L184)
- [ ] • Explain why it is necessary to approximate functions / implement own approximations [See in file](main.tex#L481)
- [ ] • details TBD [See in file](main.tex#L621)
- [ ] • Description of the functionality of the library [See in file](main.tex#L708)
- [ ] • should I mention wasted pipelining opportunities here? [See in file](main.tex#L793)
- [ ] • wording w.r.t color arithmetic seems weird? [See in file](main.tex#L1130)
- [ ] • This section needs more detail [See in file](main.tex#L1159)
- [ ] • Turn this into its own section maybe? [See in file](main.tex#L1404)
- [ ] • Paragraph on filters -> filtered out scopes count towards the parent scope in exclusive metrics [See in file](main.tex#L1442)
- [ ] • Rerun HPCTOOLKIT tests using Utah Newell Teapot instead of Dense Cube [See in file](main.tex#L1513)
- [ ] • Short recap + what can still be done: anisotropic Gaussians, loading models learned via Gaussian splatting, more efficient tiling method using SIMD, performance left on the table TBD (see results) [See in file](main.tex#L1599)
- [ ] • fill out interfaces [See in file](main.tex#L1868)
