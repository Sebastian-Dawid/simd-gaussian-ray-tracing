<!---@TODO-List-Start--->
- [ ] • describe image formation model (splatting) as laid out in the following papers [See in file](main.tex#L150)
- [ ] • What differentiates the two methods? Advantages? Disadvantages? [See in file](main.tex#L177)
- [ ] • Write introductory paragraph on optimizations [See in file](main.tex#L181)
- [ ] • describe the tiling method used. note similarities to splatting. [See in file](main.tex#L349)
- [ ] • Explain why it is necessary to approximate functions / implement own approximations [See in file](main.tex#L412)
- [ ] • Describe cubic spline interpolation [See in file](main.tex#L414)
- [ ] • details TBD [See in file](main.tex#L443)
- [ ] • Rerun HPCTOOLKIT tests using Utah Newell Teapot instead of Dense Cube [See in file](main.tex#L569)
- [ ] • Short recap + what can still be done: anisotropic gaussians, loading models learned via gaussian splatting, more efficient tiling method using SIMD, performance left on the table TBD (see results) [See in file](main.tex#L668)
