    abstract = "{Neural network simulations often spend a large proportion of their time computing exponential functions. Since the exponentiation routines of typical math libraries are rather slow, their replacement with a fast approximation can greatly reduce the overall computation time. This article describes how exponentiation can be approximated by manipulating the components of a standard (IEEE-754) floating-point representation. This models the exponential function as well as a lookup table with linear interpolation, but is significantly faster and more compact.}",

    abstract = {Abstract HPCTOOLKIT is an integrated suite of tools that supports measurement, analysis, attribution, and presentation of application performance for both sequential and parallel programs. HPCTOOLKIT can pinpoint and quantify scalability bottlenecks in fully optimized parallel programs with a measurement overhead of only a few percent. Recently, new capabilities were added to HPCTOOLKIT for collecting call path profiles for fully optimized codes without any compiler support, pinpointing and quantifying bottlenecks in multithreaded programs, exploring performance information and source code using a new user interface, and displaying hierarchical space–time diagrams based on traces of asynchronous call path samples. This paper provides an overview of HPCTOOLKIT and illustrates its utility for performance analysis of parallel applications. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
